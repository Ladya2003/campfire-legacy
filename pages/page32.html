            Well, I'm going home. Recently Dzerzhinsk is becoming less and less like home to me. Every time I think about going back there, I gain apathy. And to be absolutely honest, there's no surprise in it. This small and nothing-to-do-town is just a quite place compared to fast moving and full of fun Minsk. So, the only thing that's holding me back is parents. However, I see no problem with that. Moreover, I'll keep coming back as soon as they live there.

            My point is not in showing some place bad or another. On the contrary, I'm trying to emphasize the changes, that I experience lately. Back in the day, I felt Dzerzhinsk like home and Minsk like an alien that I don't feel comfortable to ask for directions. As for present days, it feels like tables have turned. I'm considering Minsk as my full time living area, filled with friends that also live here. And as for Dzerzhinsk, It's not feeling like home anymore. At least, not like in them old days.

            As for my personal life, I've also making changes, trying new stuff and finding out how they turn out. First time of my life, I've bought a gorgeous flowers to a girl thats not from my family. I can tell, it felt good. From choosing the right fitting bouquet to gifting it to a beautiful lady. Also we've walked for a several kilometers back then, that I wasn't been doing for a while as well. After our last meeting I've been getting mixed feelings. I loved it and would want some more, but she's busy and not the most active type of person. So, I just kinda await of her functions. Guess I should enjoy my being-single days as well as those that we spend together.
