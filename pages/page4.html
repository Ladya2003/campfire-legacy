        <hr>
        <p>
            It it is quietly raining outside. There is still much snow laying down on the ground. The landscapes are rapidly changing outside my carriage, 
            but what isnt changing is that I'm still going to my studies to Minsk. Like I do every Monday. My carriage is full of people who has their own
            business, works and studies in Minsk. It feels like everything is back on track and the world is alive again.

        <h2>Briefly about the prev. week</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The previous week was an emotional roller coaster. I met a forigner from Australia who asked me to take a picture of him in front of the towers
            opposite to the main train station. We talked for a while. He told me about his passion to travelling and it seemed like he knows Belarus well.
            As we had a nice griffindor scarfs we couldn't not to make a selfie. <br>
            Moreover I was arguing again with the hostel principal and tried a lot
            to tune the React JS envirenment and finally did it during my train trip to Minsk. 
        </p>
        <h2>Basketball is my favourite sport</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I should also admit that I played the real basketball twice that week. And each time I tried not to rush the game to play slow and wise 
            you know what it paid off because I legitimately scored a lot of decent buckets. Especially the one when
            Zhenya was in the paint and saw me running in an arc trajectory to rim, he passed me the ball as soon as I touched it without even dribbling I jumped 
            as high as I could and shot it in the most Steph Curry way. The ball flew beatifully. It went from my midrange spot all the way to the center of the
            rim making the net produce the most possibly beautiful sound in the game of basketball.<br><br>
            Also worth mantioning two times when I did an euro step and it was my first time doing it in the real game. First I succesfully did it on a good player and then
            gorgeously scored. And in just a couple of possitions I did it again except that now it was even an "and one". I also tried a spin move but that situation was a pretty 
            tough so I couldnt finish. <strong><i>"All in all after that game I got a nice overall warm feeling inside that fulfill me even now."</i></strong>
