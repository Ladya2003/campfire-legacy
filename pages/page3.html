            I took a little break in bloging. I got really many things to do recently. But hey, Im here and thats what matters...<br>
            Today is Tuesday - the beginning of the 2nd educational week. Its been okay, huge list of university things I have to do, everyday
            headache at hostel, interaction with mad principal of the hostel and attempts to trick her. In general nothing new but that teaches
            me how to cowboy up.
        </p>
        <h2>Tuesday - Busy Day</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Its only 2pm but yet there happend lots of stuff including the fact that I solved many annoying questions. I accomplished to get shelf hung up on the wall
            for me that is very nice. Also I finally got back my ID's!!! So I turned from 17 to 18 again. And last but not least yesterday
            I have finished my drawing about Afganistan War and today I presented it to the principal of the hostel. She kind of like it but politely asked for some adjustments. After I did that
            me and the boyz hung up it to the visible spot near the entrance to the hostel which is extreamly nice.<br><br>
            Strangely enough while siting at lecture last 1.5 hour I dont feel good, I dont feel tired or bored whatsoever but I feel apathy, Im mad at Beloded (well thats not that strange) and dont want to do anything. Idk I said
            thats odd for me. fuck it you feel me?

        <h2>Investment World</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I've read a statement about the main difference between rich and poor, winners and losers. Which is the way they treat the loss.<br>
            <strong><i>"The loss inspires the winners to become better and scares the fuck out of losers".</i></strong> <br>
            The same principle works with the money world.
            Smart but afraid to lose money people never become wealthy, they usually invest money in stable companies and their portforlio
            consists of stocks with minimal risks. Thats undoubtedly already a smart move but they have just a little chance of becoming rich. 
            On the other hand wealthy people invest their money into small but perspective start-ups. 
            And its always more risky to do. However they somehow make a fortunes thankfully to this plan. I was reading rich dad poor dad where the author said 
            that he has never seen a rich person that havent ever lost a single dollar. So maybe thats where all the answers to my questions lie.
