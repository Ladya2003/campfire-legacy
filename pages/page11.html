            Today I'm gonna share with you stories about my mind-blowing hangouts this 2022 summer. From now and go on there'll be headers such 
            as Daily party-goer. It means that below them will be description of the special hangout, the name of which comes after ":" in the header.

        <h2>Daily party-goer: 30th of June</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Long story short I decided to spend my summer weekends in a lot different way as I did it before. During my 2nd semester, I had 
            that unique wish to invite my old friends and new ones to one single party and have a great fun. After some planning and successful 
            finishing session, 30th of June, 2022 I invited 3 friends of mine from Dzerzhinsk Irina, Nastya and Sasha and 4 friends from university 
            Sasha, Arsenii, Zhenya and Lesha to small pavillion in nature situated in Westa near Dzerzhinsk. Honestly despite boiling hot 36°C 
            temperature outside we had a great fun. We were swimming in the lake and trying to make a backflip, playing UNO and other classic bored 
            games on the comfy cover behide the pavillion where was dark and cool, cooking chicken and pig kebab, drinking yummy drinks, enjoying the 
            gorgeous sunset and fresh air. I personally enjoyed absolutely awesome presents, my close friends to come over and spending time with 
            them a lot. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After our rest in the nature, when the sun had already gone and it was getting colder, we moved to my house and were chilling there. 
            Besides Irina's, Sasha's and Nastya's the sweetest and yummest birthday cake and invitation to scary but exciting and breathtaking 
            hang-glider, my Minsk friends Zhenya and Sasha gifted me money and Lesha and Arsenii gave me certificate for professional and the best 
            massage in Belarus, which is all extremely heartwarming and wholesome. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a pity that in the early morning we had to move to Minsk for defending our practice project, so we couldn't play basketball or 
            chill in Dzerzhinsk even more. However it was a highly valued experience and I had a ton of fun making it happen.
        </p>

        <h2>Daily party-goer: 4th of July</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            My friend Zhenya I mentioned before had his own birthday party on the 4th of July just 3 days later after my party, in which he invited 
            me as well. He rent big cottage in Fanipol and invited a bunch of people, 15 to be precise. As soon as the doors of the building were open
            and new guests were starting to arrive, we started to get know each other. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It turned out that everybody there was pretty interesting to talk to. So we immediately started playing billiard and ping pong, empty 
            bottles of beer, cooking kebab and swimming in the hot tub.
        </p>
        <p>
            The special thing about this hangout is that every single person was nice, brought his own storyline and partying like crazy. So the most 
            curious part is that Zhenya somehow collected us together and put in a nice little house of ours.

        <h2>Daily party-goer: 12th of July</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Well, two stories are gone, two to go. After 8 days from Zhenya’s party, time has come for my good friend Lesha’s birthday party, which 
            he was celebration on the 12th of July. Looking ahead it had one the most unique and special atmosphere, as Lesha invited only his 
            closest friends and by chance they are all happen to be my good pals. That’s why we weren’t shy at all and as soon as Lesha’s father 
            left us alone in his big, beautiful, with black interior and view on the picturesque river house in the village Raubichi, 40km away from 
            Minks, we immediately started partying like crazy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We were dancing to Morgenshtern, Town of Sochi, When I met in the summer tu tu when the leaves turn brown… and others remarkable artists 
            while drinking the home made cherry bear. By the way during that night I drank 2 liters of beer. However, the main part of our night 
            activities were heart-to-heart conversations and we talked a lot starting from the stories when we’ve met and finishing with the stories 
            from our childhood. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I can’t but admit the feeling that I got, when after we were talking till 3 AM, we went upstairs to play billiard, I was looking through 
            the window at the dark river once for a while and every time it was becoming more and more lighter, showing us the coming morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway we fell in sleep at around 6-7 AM and slept till 12 PM. After we woke up Lesha’s grandpa invited us to the second of two big houses 
            that is also standing on their territory to have breakfast. As soon as we crossed the threshold of their house grandma fed us delicious 
            pancakes and other goodies making our stomach go full in 10 minutes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After we had breakfast grandpa drove us to lesha’s third house, where we also had a great fun playing bored games. In the evening everyone 
            went home and when I met my sister we took a train and came home.
        </p>
        <p>
            By all means Lesha’s party was full of funny and unique moments thankfully to which I warmly remember that party.
        </p>

        <h2>Daily party-goer: 16th of July</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Last but not least came Sasha’s party. Honestly, it was the most random and spontaneous one yet, which made it absolutely wild. 
            As we pulled up to her house, we got drunk badly right away and at the same time met lit chicks and boyyz at the party. Yeah…last time 
            I was as drunk at my prom. The only thing I truly remember is that we were dancing to shockingly loud music and drinking voronovo samagon 
            thinking it was whiskey. Also I tried to pick up one hot girl but I drank too much that night so my brain couldn’t function properly. 
            And as matter of fact I was lucky enough because there was one guy who was also hitting on her, so later that night this girl’s ex-bf 
            suddenly pulled up on us and kicked his ass. Lucky me:)
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, me and my boys were having a great fun when everybody left us with that loud speaker and we turned on our favorite tracks. 
            Anyway after we danced for a several hours, we got tired and went to take a little nap. Some why, Arsenii and I couldn’t really find our
             dreams so we decided to went outside for a refreshing walk. It was early in the morning, fresh air, till sunrise was 3 more hours. 
             We were walking around and talking heart-to-heart about girls, living alone, cars and other boy’s stuff. By our returning to the crib, 
             we found out that everyone is sleeping and we don’t have our sleeping place anymore. Some kid was sleeping on our bed. There was no other 
             way but to settle down in the kitchen. We found a big soft toy bunny on which we slept on and stole from sleeping pals a couple of blankets. 
            It was a pretty nice 3 hour dream which helped us move the 4-hour drive back home.

        <h2>The conclusion</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Just wanna say that I somehow managed to combine finishing the first course at the university, planning my party and participating in 
            others. Overall, I’ve been at 4 great hangouts recent 3 weeks and had insane fun going through them all. Starting from my own party, 
            when I mostly enjoyed the nature and people around me, then the very next day going to the defense of the practice project at university 
            with crazy hangover, and awesome Zhenya’s cottage party, finishing with atmospheric Lesha’s one and Sasha’s mind-blowing piece of wildness.
        </p>
