            Today I'm gonna share with you stories about my mind-blowing hangouts this 2022 summer. From now and go on there'll be headers such 
            as Daily party-goer. It means that below them will be description of the special hangout, the name of which comes after ":" in the header.
        </p>
        <h2>Daily party-goer: 30th of June</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Long story short I decided to spend my summer weekends in a lot different way as I did it before. During my 2nd semester, I had 
            that unique wish to invite my old friends and new ones to one single party and have a great fun. After some planning and successful 
            finishing session, 30th of June, 2022 I invited 3 friends of mine from Dzerzhinsk Irina, Nastya and Sasha and 4 friends from university 
            Sasha, Arsenii, Zhenya and Lesha to small pavillion in nature situated in Westa near Dzerzhinsk. Honestly despite boiling hot 36°C 
            temperature outside we had a great fun. We were swimming in the lake and trying to make a backflip, playing UNO and other classic bored 
            games on the comfy cover behide the pavillion where was dark and cool, cooking chicken and pig kebab, drinking yummy drinks, enjoying the 
            gorgeous sunset and fresh air. I personally enjoyed absolutely awesome presents, my close friends to come over and spending time with 
            them a lot. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After our rest in the nature, when the sun had already gone and it was getting colder, we moved to my house and were chilling there. Besides Irina's, Sasha's and Nastya's the sweetest and yummest birthday cake and invitation to scary but exciting and breathtaking hang-glider, my Minsk friends Zhenya and Sasha gifted me money and Lesha and Arsenii gave me certificate for professional and the best massage in Belarus, which is all extremely heartwarming and wholesome. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a petty that in the early morning we had to move to Minsk for defending our practice project, so we couldn't play basketball or chill in Dzerzhinsk even more. However it was a highly valued experience and I had a ton of fun making it happend.
        </p>
        <h2>Daily party-goer: 4th of July</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            My friend Zhenya I mentioned before had his own birthday party on the 4th of July just 3 days later after my party, in which he invited me as well. He rent big cottage in Fanipol and invited a bunch of people, 15 to be precise. As soon as the doors of the building were open and new guests were starting to arrive, we started to get know each other. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It turned out that everybody there was pretty interesting to talk to. So we immediately started playing billiard and ping pong, empty bottles of beer, cooking kebab and swimming in the hot tub.
        </p>
        <p>
            The special thing about this hangout is that every single person was nice, brought his own storyline and partying like crazy. So the most curious part is that Zhenya somehow collected us together and put in a nice little house of ours.
        </p>
