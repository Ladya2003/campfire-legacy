        <h2>To the new beginnings</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> I personally dont know the purfect way to start those little stories. I guess I will begin them with one little story. 
            After I done my uneversity business and came back to hostel I can surely secury you that Today was a tough day just like other days on the first week of semester. 
            In the morning I was woken up by the local dorm fitter. Sursprusingly I wasnt angry. And after I done doing my exercises I began working on this web-site.
            I finished "About me" part, stylized "My Works" and built "Contacts Info". All in all I did a great job in the morning.
            On the afternoon I went to my university and got tired pretty quick. 
        </p>
        <p> You know sometimes its really hard to listen some guy who is
            trying to teach you something, which I sincerely dont want to listen and study. At the same moment I want to get 
            the Specialist Diploma, get the fuck out of here and find stable highly paid job, so I can afford my and my gf wishes,
            so I can always finanshially help my parents if needed, and so I learn how to make money at any time. 
        </p>
        <p> By the way I reckon that
            uni cant actually help me reach the last goal. I think that I have to become financially educated and have experience in trading stocks.
            I really want to built a sustained base for my future and have an everyday job in IT that I will like a lot. And also the fact
            that I will have a chance to always move further in my IT career and gain more and more experience becomimg greater speacialist makes
            me glad that I've chosen this sphere. But that is not exact legacy I want to leave after I die. What also I want to do is to know how
            pure become rich, how rich become wealthy, how to leave a dinasty and even companes after retirement. Those questions interest me a lot.
            I think I have a little passion for finense world. I mean not the real basics of it but how to make money and deal with them, how to
            make money work on themselves and me. And finally I dont want to work my whole life if it wont bring me joyness anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall I think that game plan is lit&#128293;. And after I reach those goals maybe I will finally become self-confident.<br>
            Lets wrap things up and create a list of the goals.
            <h2>The Goal List</h2>
