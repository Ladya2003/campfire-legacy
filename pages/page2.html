        <h2>The moving</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I've worked hard one more day. Today was especially hard because of the moving to different room in my hostel.
            The craziest part is how that huge amount of things can fit in one bedside table, one wordrobe, one locker and one bed.
            The moving cost me three hours. Three long physically difficult hours in the bright nice morning of Wednesday.

            Then went simple compared to what Ive already been through hours in the university with my groupmates. Ive helped my new teacher of
            belarusian language and she introduced herself to us. She made an impression of good specialist and kind, ready to give a helping hand 
            person. Also I met Michail Sergeevich Kapuro - the GOAT of teaching math sceince and interaction with teenage kids like us.

            When the sun is going down my first day at new place in the 217th room is nearing its logical conclusion. I have some work to do in 
            getting used to new roommates, atmosphere and a banch of new people.

        <h2>Unexpected letter</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When I was with my groupmates this afternoon in the place dedicated to smoke there, I accidently checked my email. There was a letter
            from the client I offered my services in building a web-site one week ago. Honestly I sent a couple prepositions to different people who need a 
            web-site and noone answered so I lost hope. However when I saw that letter I immediately felt butterflies in my stomach. I thought that
            I fucked it up because it was sent 4 days ago so anything could happened. Luckily the client and his boss replied to me so nothing is lost yet!
