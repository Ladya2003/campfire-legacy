            Did you know that 27 is essentially 3 raised to the 3rd power? Just as in math, life revolves around three things: Love, Career and Hobbies. If any of these is lacking, it becomes nearly impossible to achieve balance. If life were a rope stretched through a deep pit, then seeking balance would seem like the right thing to do. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">
            I’m not quite sure where I’m heading with this, but my point is that I’ve never really contemplated balance in my life. Nonetheless, it has always found a way to steer my life for the better.

            I’m 20 years old, my name is Vlad and in the couple of words I’ll attempt to draw you into my world. Daily lectures, the same auditoriums, people, events, routines. Not much changes from month to month, year to year. Such monotonous and miserable existence has worried me for a long time, but for lack of better option, had to face with loneliness and sadness.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">
            However, remember when I mentioned life’s balance? Well, it’s an open secret: life tends to set things right. After a period of misfortunate and unhappiness, brighter and more fulfilling days will follow. At least, that’s what I believe.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">
            Full disclosure, my life abides by this ideology. Despite the routine and mundanity, I’ve been fortune enough to meet incredible, kind and intelligent individuals with whom I’ve shared some of the greatest moments of my life. And on the other side, in spite of tedious laboratory works, I’ve got invited to internship at renowned local IT company. This opportunity has already provided me with a wealth of knowledge about the IT market in Belarus. I don’t want to get on my high horse, but future looks promising. Slowly but surely, I’m immersing myself in the IT realm.

            I remember a time when I used to feel lonely and battled a persistent urge to return home. However, recently something clicked in me. Instead of that familiar loneliness, I’ve been staying in Minsk for three weeks straight and feel gassed out practically constantly.
