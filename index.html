                Moreover, when in the 2nd semester of study at my university, a question<br> arose about a course project, I decided to provide this particular blog. 
            </p>

                Anyways as I've been coding for some time, I got couple decent works to show you.
                The first work is my personal favourite. It's the Network of Minsk most popular Restaurants. The second work is dedicated to very good friend
                of mine Irina. She turned 18 recently so I decided to make something special for her. The third work is my final project work for JavaScript subject
                after the first semester at my University. And the final work is pretty hard to explain. It basically gives you the random series of Supernatural TV Series.
