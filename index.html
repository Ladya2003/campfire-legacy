            <p>
                Hello, stranger! Come sit down with me near this pleasent fireplace. My name is Vladislav Vakulenchik, but friends and family call me Vladik. 
                I'm 18 y.o. and I've been into programing for 5 years and eventually I got better. 
                I may not know every answer but I always know how to find the way out, so Im a capable young man.
                I live in Belarus and after school I entered technological university in Minsk. So I'm in a perfect place. <br><br>
                Right now im in a train on the way to Minsk to my university and opposite to me is siting beautiful young lady
                that looks sad for some reason. She has chains on her boots and jeans that look fire and brutal for me. She is wearing black clothes. 
                And also she was kind enough to hold down the door for me which I respect a lot.
                Here is problem I want to get acquainted with her, coz she looks cool and kind but broo how can I do that? What should I say?
                Well I didn't find the right words so we went different pathes. <br>
                There are lots of similar stories happening to me. So if you want to read something interesting here some more stories about me:<br><br>

            </p>
            <h2 id="my_projects">My Projects & Works</h2>
            <p>
                Anyways as I've been coding for some time, I got couple decent works to show you.<br>
                The first work is my personal favourite. It's the Network of Minsk most popular Restaurants. The second work is dedicated to very good friend
                of mine Irina. She turned 18 recently so I decided to make something special for her. The third work is my final project work for JavaScript subject
                after the first semester at my University. And the final work is pretty hard to explain. It basically gives you the random series of Supernatural TV Series.
